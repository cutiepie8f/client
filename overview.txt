                                OR

    Lifecycle of REACT js: 3phases
        1. Mounting Phase:  Initial mount to the DOM
                > Contructors
                > Render
                > ComponentDidMount - Calling of the APIs to bind the data

        2. Updating Phase:  User Interaction
                > Render

        3. Unmounting Phase:    Component gets unmounted from the DOM
                > ComponentDidMount - Store the data at Local Storage or Session Storage

    
    Things to check while converting HTML page to REACT:
        -> Comments in HTML <!-- --> needs to be changed by {/*  */}
        -> In react all tags must be closed. (in case of self closing tags must be closed like -> <img />)
        -> In react inline style needs to be written inside {{ }} - double curly brackets.
        -> In HTML class needs to be replaced by className.
        -> In React all the variables are written inside " " - double Qoutes.
